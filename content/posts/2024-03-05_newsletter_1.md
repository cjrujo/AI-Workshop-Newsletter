1. **虚拟化物理服务器**：一个关键的初始步骤，涉及从物理服务器转移到云平台，为更灵活、可扩展的基础设施奠定基础。

2. **Transforming the Code Base**: Legacy applications often require a transformation of their code base, such as moving from COBOL to more modern languages like Java, C#, or .Net. This not only makes them compatible with cloud environments but also enhances their performance and maintainability.

2. **转换代码库**：传统应用程序通常需要转换其代码库，例如从COBOL转移到更现代的语言，如Java、C#或.Net。这不仅使它们与云环境兼容，还提高了它们的性能和可维护性。

3. **Enhancing User Experience**: Adding a modern UI/UX veneer to legacy applications not only improves their aesthetics but also their usability, making them more appealing to today's users.

3. **增强用户体验**：为传统应用程序添加现代UI/UX外观不仅提高了它们的美学，还提高了它们的可用性，使它们对当今用户更具吸引力。

4. **Integrating API Interfaces**: By adding API interfaces to legacy applications, organizations can ensure their systems are more interconnected and can easily communicate with other applications and services within the cloud ecosystem.

4. **集成API接口**：通过向传统应用程序添加API接口，组织可以确保它们的系统更加互联，并且可以轻松地与云生态系统中的其他应用程序和服务通信。

## Conclusion

## 结论

The role of DevOps in migrating legacy applications to cloud infrastructure is undeniable. By championing collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, DevOps not only facilitates a smoother transition to the cloud but also unlocks the full potential of cloud computing. As organizations embark on this pioneering journey, the principles of DevOps will guide them towards a future where their legacy systems are transformed into cloud giants, ready to meet the demands of the modern digital world.

DevOps在将传统应用程序迁移到云基础设施中的作用是不可否认的。通过倡导协作、自动化和持续改进，DevOps不仅促进了向云的平滑过渡，还释放了云计算的全部潜力。随着组织开始这一开拓性旅程，DevOps的原则将引导它们走向一个未来，其中他们的传统系统被转变为云巨头，准备满足现代数字世界的需求。

# Demystifying AI in Oncology: Beyond the Hype

# 揭秘肿瘤学中的AI：超越炒作

In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a beacon of hope, particularly in the fight against cancer. However, the headline "AI will cure cancer" not only oversimplifies a complex issue but also misinterprets the capabilities of AI and the nature of medicine itself. This article aims to set the record straight, debunking common misconceptions and shedding light on the genuine role of AI in oncology.

在快速发展的医疗保健领域中，人工智能（AI）成为希望的灯塔，特别是在与癌症的斗争中。然而，“AI将治愈癌症”的标题不仅过于简化了一个复杂的问题，还误解了AI的能力和医学本身的性质。本文旨在澄清记录，揭穿常见的误解，并阐明AI在肿瘤学中的真正作用。

## Unraveling Misconceptions

## 揭开误解

The notion that AI can single-handedly cure cancer is a profound misunderstanding of both AI's current capabilities and the intricacies of cancer treatment. AI, at its core, is a tool designed to augment human efforts, not replace them. It excels in processing vast amounts of data at speeds unattainable by humans, identifying patterns that might go unnoticed, and providing insights based on data analysis. However, AI lacks the nuanced understanding and ethical reasoning of a human physician. It operates within the confines of its programming and the data it has been trained on, making it an invaluable assistant rather than a standalone solution.

认为AI可以独自治愈癌症是对AI当前能力和癌症治疗复杂性的深刻误解。AI的核心是一个旨在增强人类努力的工具，而不是替代它们。它擅长以人类无法达到的速度处理大量数据，识别可能被忽视的模式，并基于数据分析提供洞察。然而，AI缺乏人类医生的细腻理解和伦理推理。它在其编程和训练数据的限制内运作，使其成为一种宝贵的助手，而不是独立的解决方案。

### Ethical Challenges and Adoption Rates

### 伦理挑战和采用率

The integration of AI into healthcare brings forth ethical challenges and uncertainties, particularly in clinical trials and patient care. Despite the potential benefits, the adoption rate among healthcare professionals remains modest, with surveys indicating that only 10% to 30% of physicians have utilized clinical AI tools. This discrepancy highlights the need for further education and transparency in the deployment of AI technologies in medicine.

将AI整合到医疗保健中带来了伦理挑战和不确定性，特别是在临床试验和患者护理中。尽管有潜在的好处，但医疗专业人员的采用率仍然适中，调查显示只有10%到30%的医生使用了临床AI工具。这种差异突显了在医学中部署AI技术需要进一步教育和透明度的需求。

## Real-World Applications in Cancer Treatment

## 癌症治疗中的实际应用

AI's impact on oncology is undeniable, with several technologies receiving approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in radiology and beyond. AI applications in cancer care range from improving diagnosis and prognosis to personalizing treatment plans and enhancing patient-physician communication. For instance, AI algorithms have shown promise in detecting skin cancers more efficiently than traditional methods. Moreover, AI is instrumental in analyzing oncology imaging, predicting treatment complications, and understanding individual patient risk factors, thereby facilitating a more tailored approach to cancer care.

AI对肿瘤学的影响是不可否认的，几项技术已获得美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）的批准，用于放射学及其他领域。AI在癌症护理中的应用范围从改善诊断和预后到个性化治疗计划和增强患者-医生沟通。例如，AI算法在检测皮肤癌方面比传统方法更有效。此外，AI在分析肿瘤学成像、预测治疗并发症和了解个别患者风险因素方面发挥着重要作用，从而促进了更加量身定制的癌症护理方法。

### The Future of AI in Oncology

### 肿瘤学中AI的未来

As AI continues to advance, its potential to transform cancer care delivery becomes increasingly evident. Beyond diagnostic and prognostic applications, AI has the potential to reduce administrative burdens on clinicians, thereby improving their resilience and allowing more time for patient care. However, it's crucial to recognize that AI's role is to support—not replace—the expertise of healthcare professionals.

随着AI的不断进步，其改变癌症护理提供方式的潜力变得越来越明显。除了诊断和预后应用外，AI有潜力减轻临床医生的行政负担，从而提高他们的韧性并为患者护理留出更多时间。然而，重要的是要认识到AI的作用是支持——而不是替代——医疗专业人员的专业知识。

## Conclusion: A Collaborative Path Forward

## 结论：一条协作的前进道路

The journey towards harnessing AI in the fight against cancer is a collaborative one, requiring the combined efforts of technologists, clinicians, and patients. By addressing misconceptions and focusing on the realistic applications of AI in oncology, we can navigate the complexities of cancer treatment with a more informed and hopeful perspective. AI holds the promise of enhancing cancer care, but it is through the synergy of human intelligence and artificial intelligence that we will make the most significant strides in this ongoing battle.

在利用AI对抗癌症的旅程中，需要技术人员、临床医生和患者的共同努力。通过解决误解并关注AI在肿瘤学中的现实应用，我们可以以更加了解和充满希望的视角应对癌症治疗的复杂性。AI承诺将增强癌症护理，但正是通过人类智能和人工智能的协同作用，我们将在这场持续的战斗中取得最显著的进步。
